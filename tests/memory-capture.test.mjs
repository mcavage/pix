// Unit tests for extensions/memory-capture.ts's capture-filtering predicate.
// Run: node --test tests/
//
// Root cause this guards: setup.go's onboardingKickoff is a synthesized
// user-role message (not something the user typed), and the watcher model
// observed it like a real statement and invented pix facts/events from
// it. The fix is a marker contract: setup.go prefixes any generated message
// with "[pix-generated:...] " and shouldCaptureUserText skips it.
